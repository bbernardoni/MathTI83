# MathTI83

A Math Program for the TI 83+ written in Z80 Assembly

### About

The goal of this project was to create an extensive math program for my TI83+ calculator. There are two options for
programming languages. The first is TI-BASIC, which is a high level interpreted language. Since it is an interpreted
language it runs very slow. Additionally you do not have much control over the display. The second option is Z80 
Assembly. While this is much harder to program in, the advantages are well worth the increased development time.

### Development

Delevolpment was started on December of 2013. I had no previous experience with any concepts of computer architecture
or assembly language. Needless to say, I learned a lot about both of these topics and now have a deep appreciation for
high level languages. 

I used Latenite to compile and test my code. It can be downloaded from here: http://www.benryves.com/products/latenite
